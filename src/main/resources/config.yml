# to how many partitions split player count
# ex: 105 players on server, if you specify {update-partitions-amount} as 4 it will split player inventory calculation
# for 4 parts; 25, 25, 25, 30, every part will be calculated every {task-schedule-time}, with default value of 20,
# it will take server 4 seconds to calculate all players inventory, and it will constantly repeat
