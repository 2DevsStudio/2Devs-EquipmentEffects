### Configuration ###

```yaml
# this is version of config, if it is different from plugin version that means that you have outdated config!
config-version: ${project.version}

# partition minimum players amount multiplier
# that's multiplier of {update-partitions-amount}, if you have this value set to 4, and you use
# default 2 multiplier, it will enable partitioning when you have at least 8 players, below this number
# it will update for all players at once
#
# 2 is minimum, otherwise it can throw an IllegalArgumentException
partition-minimum-players-multiplier: 2

# to how many partitions split player count
# ex: 105 players on server, if you specify {update-partitions-amount} as 4 it will split player inventory calculation
# for 4 parts; 25, 25, 25, 30, every part will be calculated every {task-schedule-time}, with default value of 20,
# it will take server 4 seconds to calculate all players inventory, and it will constantly repeat
update-partitions-amount: 4

# update player inventory(apply effects) task period, in ticks(20 ticks = 1 sec)
task-schedule-time: 20
